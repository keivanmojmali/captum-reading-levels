    "# Figuring out which features are the most important for classifying reading levels with LLaMA-3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will utilize the LLaMA-3 model to classify various text passages according to their reading levels. Our primary objective is to not only get the reading level predictions but also to understand the underlying reasons behind these predictions. To achieve this, we will employ the Captum library, which is designed for model interpretability, to identify and analyze the features that are most influential in the model's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Use the LLaMA-3 model to determine the reading levels of various text passages.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Implement Captum to dissect the model's predictions and pinpoint the key features that contribute to the determined reading levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLaMA-3 Model**: A state-of-the-art language model designed for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification.\n",
    "- **Captum**: An interpretability library for PyTorch models, which helps in understanding how input features affect a model's output.\n",
    "- **PyTorch**: The underlying framework for both LLaMA-3 and Captum, facilitating model operations and data manipulations.\n",
    "- **Transformers**: Provides easy access to pre-trained models like LLaMA-3 and utilities for NLP tasks.\n",
    "- **Boto3**: For interacting with AWS services, assuming the model is hosted on AWS.\n",
    "- **JupyterLab**: The development environment to create and execute our notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Configure the environment and install all necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. **Model Loading**: Load the LLaMA-3 model and configure it for our text classification task.\n",
    "3. **Data Preparation**: Prepare and preprocess the text passages for classification.\n",
    "4. **Model Prediction**: Classify the reading levels of the passages using LLaMA-3.\n",
    "5. **Feature Analysis with Captum**: Apply Captum's interpretability tools to analyze the influence of various features on the model's predictions.\n",
    "6. **Visualization**: Visualize the results to clearly understand the impact of different features.\n",
    "7. **Evaluation and Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and evaluate the effectiveness of the feature analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to provide insights into the decision-making process of the LLaMA-3 model in classifying reading levels, enhancing transparency and trust in AI applications in education.\n",
